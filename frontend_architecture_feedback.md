**Subject:** Re: Load Deep-Scan Report Implementation - Architecture Feedback

---

Hi Frontend Team,

Great work on the UI implementation! The dashboard integration and user experience flow look excellent. However, I need to clarify the data architecture to prevent some issues.

## âœ… What's Perfect
- Dashboard UI and user experience flow
- Error handling for 429s and failed scans  
- Data extraction with fallbacks
- Integration with `/analysis-status/:jobId`

## ðŸš¨ Critical Architecture Issue

You're storing the full deep scan report in your database:
```javascript
await databaseService.saveDeepScanReport(brandName, category, data);
```

**Please remove this.** Here's why:

1. **We moved to Firestore specifically to avoid storing large reports in your DB**
2. **You're duplicating data** - the report exists in both Firestore and your DB
3. **Sync issues** - if Firestore updates, your copy becomes stale
4. **Storage waste** - each report is ~50-200KB

## âœ… Correct Architecture

**Your Database Should Store (lightweight metadata only):**
```javascript
{
  jobId: 'job_abc123',
  brandName: 'Tesla', 
  category: 'Technology',
  competitorUrls: ['https://tesla.com'],
  scanState: 'completed',
  date: serverTimestamp(),
  hasReport: true  // just a boolean flag
}
```

**Firestore Stores (heavy report data):**
- The actual analysis results
- Accessed via `/analysis-status/:jobId`

## Required Changes

1. **Remove** `saveDeepScanReport()` method entirely
2. **Remove** the report data storage from your status polling
3. **Keep** the lightweight metadata tracking (jobId, status, etc.)
4. **Keep** the UI logic - it's perfect as-is

## Why This Matters

The current approach works in testing but will cause:
- Database bloat (reports are large)
- Sync issues between your DB and Firestore
- Unnecessary complexity in your codebase

The UI implementation is spot-on. We just need to fix the data storage layer.

Let me know if you need clarification on any of this!

Best,
